in this meeting of the berkeley even deeper understanding group speaker mn015 presented the results of an experiment of the dialogue system wizard created for the tourist domain the experiment consisted of leading a subject to believe she were talking to a computer then having the computer break down and be replaced with a human the group then discussed improvements to the programs user interface personnel issues regarding further data collection as well as conceptual and architectural issues regarding the wizard the introduction needs to be shortened and streamlined a graduate student will be hired to oversee further testing in a forthcoming meeting the refinement of the test data and the technicalities of the testing process will be discussed linguistic expertise and world knowledge is needed to improve the system instructions to the test subject were not clear enough as she did not follow them precisely it might be difficult to find subjects that can cope with the reading task what kind of information should be used by the system how should this information be derived from the user query the dialogue context and the ontology how should it be encoded the system can only deal with a limited amount of input can cognitive linguistics be used to get powerful generalisations how can a parser make use of spatial adverbs the subject of the demo was convinced that she was talking to a system and behaved accordingly therefore the concept of the wizard seems feasible 
two research teams one from the us and the other from germany meet to discuss smartkom a multimodal tourist information system a german version of the tool has already been developed and the objective is to collaborate to develop an english version the researchers discuss whether to develop the english parser from scratch or to adopt the style used for ther german parser they make an appointment to meet later in the week to discuss their progress the goal of the system is being presented as to provide directions to toourists based not only on their destination but also on their intentions eg taking a picture or bying souvenirs the researchers discuss various design issues eg how the components of the system should interact and whether the approach to the english system needs to be fundamentally different from that of ther german improvements for the german version such as adding a syntactic analysis are also discussed concluding the dialogue a researcher from the us team recommends that the german team hear a forthcoming talk on using deep semantics in applications 
members of the berkeley even deeper understanding group discussed speaker mn015s upcoming thesis proposal on construal in the tourism domain speaker mn015 presented an outline of a forthcoming talk for which the other members provided feedback the group then discussed construal ambiguities of various verb phrases and ways to resolve them a deadline for the submission of feedback to speaker mn015 has been set speaker mn015 will incorporate some of speaker fe004s work on x schemas in his forthcoming talks the preliminary draft contains spelling errors it also lacks detail on metaphor and metonymy more examples are needed from the tourist domain speaker mn015 needs to adjust the contents of his presentation for different audiences how does speaker mn015 intend to deal with ellipsis speaker mn015 had submitted a preliminary version of his thesis proposal to other members of the group he is scheduled to present his proposal to various research centres in europe he had already implemented a tabletbased parser and a generational outputter 
in the first part of the berkeley meeting recorder group meeting members discuss a potential collaboration with an external researcher on inference structures in dialogue in the second part speaker mn005 presents his work on detecting overlap of acoustic events the implications of which are discussed by the group finally the members discuss the current data status and plans for further data collection as well as techniques to improve speech recognition such as speaker adaptation and echo cancellation acoustic information such as prosody and voice directionality should be used to supplement lexical information in order to save time only speaker overlaps should be marked in the future there are plans to collect further meeting data both from internal and external sources and the aim is to collect over a hundred hours worth of speech it is much more difficult to infer information from facetoface meetings than from narrative frequent use of pronouns also adds difficulty identifying individuals in publications might lead to slander charges there are discrepancies between speech signals recorded on individual microphones and the pzm detecting overlap of all acoustic events is very timeconsuming three hundred overlapping acoustic events have been found in fortyfive minutes of speech speaker me011 has written a bootstrapping program about twelve hours of meetings have already been recorded 
in the first part of the berkeley meeting recorder group meeting members discussed the results and implications of a spoken digit recognition experiment using lapel microphones and the hidden markov model toolkit htk  it is reported that while the lapel microphones deliver good results the htk is outperformed by the sri toolkit comparisons to other digit corpora such as ti are also made the second part of the discussion focused on alignment of multiple speaker channels specifically the problems of overlapping speech and backchannelling speaker adaptation was identified as an important issue is recognition as well as alignment the performance difference between htk and sri must be due to the lack of phoneloop and means and variance adaptation for htk for realistic experimental results cheap microphones should be used rather than expensive ones speaker fe016 is planning to submit a paper on alignment to eurospeech lapel microphones are sensitive to noises such as clothes rustling recognition of digits recorded with close microphones is significantly more difficult than that of studiorecorded tidigits the amount of close microphone data is too small to train a reliable hidden markov model alignment quality is detrimentally affected by background speech lapel microphone performed well on a spoken digit recognition task it is suggested that their robustness due to the fact that they are omnidirectional it is discovered that the optimal pruning parameters are different for recognition and for alignment 
the berkeley robustness group discussed various projects by students and research staff first speaker fn002 presented her experimental results on voiceunvoice detection speaker me006 talked about his work on testing completeness for acoustic events and his plans for using support vector machines to recognise phonological features speakers me013 and me018 discussed improvements to the current implementation of the rasta feature representation finally speaker me026 presented his experiment with the mean subtraction method and the group discussed its implications speaker fn002 will work on a project for france telecom speaker me006 will conduct a preliminary experiment to see if the features he plans to use are sufficient he will also compare the performance of support vector machines to that of recurrent neural nets on a classification task speaker me018 will rerun his experiment on a smaller dataset for the purpose of troubleshooting speaker me013 argues that additional features used by speaker fn002 are not optimal and suggests an alternative approach the results of speaker fn002s experiment are worse than expected probably due to additive noise speaker fn002 needs clarification regarding the details of the forthcoming france telecom project will support vector machines perform as well as recurrent neural nets with less data how can probabilities be estimated from the binary output of a svm classifier speaker me018 suspects a bug in his speech recognition software as the performance difference between the plp and mel cepstrum feature representations seems too large can the mean subtraction method perform as well with an industrystandard speech recogniser speaker fn002 has conducted experiments with new features to detect voiceunvoice speaker me006 has assembled most of his quals committee speaker me026 has greatly improved performance of htk speech recogniser by applying the mean subtraction method
