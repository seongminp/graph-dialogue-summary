A	hey , you 're not supposed to be drinking in here dude .
A	do we have to read them that slowly ?
A	sounded like robot .
A	when you read the numbers it reminded me of beat poetry .
D	tried to go for the ee cummings feeling ,
A	three three six zero .
A	that 's what of when of beat poetry .
A	you ever seen " so married an axe murderer " ?
C	parts of it .
A	there 's part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .
A	and he talks like that .
A	that 's why thi
A	that probably is why of it that way .
D	no , didn't see that movie .
D	who did who made that ?
A	mike meyers is the guy .
A	it - it 's his it 's his cute romantic comedy .
A	that 's that 's
A	that 's his cute romantic comedy , .
A	the other thing that 's real funny , 'll spoil it for you .
A	is when he 's he works in coffee shop ,
A	in san francisco ,
A	and he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso ,
A	and he 's like " excuse me ordered the large espresso ? "
D	we 're having ,
D	tiramisu tasting contest this weekend .
A	so you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?
D	there was fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best
D	and so we decided to have contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,
D	and then we got panel of impartial judges that will taste do blind taste and then vote .
D	should be fun .
A	seems like you could put magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours .
A	then , if you were to bribe them , you could
D	you guys have plans for sunday ?
D	we 're we 're not
D	it 's probably going to be this sunday , but we 're working with the weather here
D	because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever , can throw it on there .
D	so only the tiramisu is free , nothing else .
A	'm going back to visit my parents this weekend ,
A	so , 'll be out of town .
D	so you 're going to the west bay then ?
A	no , the south bay ,
C	should be free ,
A	is nancy gonna show up ?
A	wonder if these things ever emit very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ?
D	they are gonna get more comfortable headsets .
D	they already ordered them .
D	let 's get started .
D	should go first , with the , , data .
D	can have the remote control .
D	so . on friday we had our wizard test data test and these are some of the results .
D	this was the introduction .
D	actually , even though liz was kind enough to offer to be the first subject , felt that she knew too much ,
D	so asked litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was kind enough to serve as the first subject .
D	so , this is what she saw as part of as for instr introduction ,
D	this is what she had to read aloud .
D	that was really difficult for her
C	because of all the names , you mean ?
D	this was the first three tasks she had to master after she called the system ,
D	and then the system broke down ,
D	and those were the
D	should say the system was supposed to break down and then these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with human
D	there are here are the results .
D	we will skip the reading now .
D	the reading was five minutes , exactly .
D	and now comes the
D	this is the phone - in phase of
C	can have question .
C	so . so there 's no system ,
C	like , there was wizard for both both parts ,
C	is this right ?
D	it was bo it both times the same person .
D	one time , pretending to be system ,
D	one time , to pretending to be human , which is actually not pretending .
C	isn't this obvious when it says " now you 're talking to human " and then the human has the same voice ?
D	good question , but
D	you just and see .
D	it 's you 're gonna learn .
D	and the wizard sometimes will not be audible ,
D	because she was actually they there was some lapse in the wireless ,
D	we have to move her closer .
A	is she mispronouncing " anlage " ?
A	is it " anlaga " or " anlunga "
D	they 're mispronouncing everything ,
D	this is the system breaking down , actually .
D	" did call europe ? "
D	so , this is it .
B	so , are you trying to record this meeting ?
D	there was strange reflex .
D	'm really out of it .
D	the lessons learned .
D	the reading needs to be shorter .
D	five minutes is just too long .
D	that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order .
D	and she did not .
C	it 's surprising .
D	she she jumped around quite bit .
B	so if you just number them " one " , " two " , " three " it 's
D	and make it clear in the
D	we need to so that 's one thing .
D	and we need better introduction for the wizard .
D	that is something that fey actually thought of in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called .
D	and , another suggestion , by liz , was that we , through subjects , switch the tasks .
D	so when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with human , and .
D	so we get data for that .
D	we have to refine the tasks more and more , which we haven't done , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing ,
D	so where , even though we don't tell the person " ask blah - blah - blah "
D	they still try , or at least litonya tried to repeat as much of that text as possible .
C	say exactly what 's on there ?
D	and my suggestion is we keep the wizard , because she did wonderful job ,
D	in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for ,
D	" how much is bus ticket and transfer "
D	so this is gonna happen all the time , we you can never be .
D	johno pointed out that we have maybe grammatical gender problem there with wizard .
A	wasn't wasn't whether wizard was the correct term for " not man " .
C	there 's no female equivalent of
C	not that know of .
D	there is witch and warlock ,
A	that 's so @ @ .
C	that 's what was thinking , but
D	so , some work needs to be done , but we can
D	and this , and in case no you hadn't seen it , this is what litonya looked at during the while taking the while partaking in the data collection .
B	so first of all , agree that we should hire fey , and start paying her .
B	probably pay for the time she 's put in as .
B	do exactly how to do that ,
B	what exactly do we do to put her on the payroll in some way ?
D	'm completely clueless , but 'm willing to learn .
B	you 'll have to .
B	so why don't you ask lila
B	and see what she says about exactly what we do for someone in
D	student - type worker ,
B	she 's un she 's not student ,
B	she sounded fine ,
B	she actually was , more , present and than she was in conversation ,
B	so she did better job than would have guessed from just talking to her .
B	so that 's great .
D	this is what gave her , so this is how to get to the student prison ,
D	and didn't even spell it out here
D	and in some cases spelled it out little bit more thoroughly ,
D	this is the information on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up ,
D	and , so if we give her even more , instruments to work with the results are gonna be even better .
B	and then as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ .
B	so that 's great .
B	and also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and that would be wonderful .
B	and , she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in an experimental paradigm ,
B	so this is all just fine in terms of her learning things she 's gonna need to know , to do her career .
B	so , my is she 'll be quite happy to take on that job .
D	she didn't explicitly state that
D	and told her that we gonna figure out meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and look for the potential sources to find people .
D	she also agrees that if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that
B	as say there is this set of people next door , it 's not hard to
D	however , we may run into problem with reading task there .
D	and , we 'll see .
B	we could talk to the people who run it and see if they have way that they could easily tell people that there 's task , pays ten bucks ,
B	but you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated .
B	and and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .
B	so that 's good .
B	now , signed us up for the wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this .
B	my idea on that was , partly we 'll talk about system for the computer scientists ,
B	but partly did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically ,
B	because to the extent that we can get them contributing ,
B	that will be good .
B	so this issue about re - formulating things ,
B	maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it ,
B	other linguists , if you 're linguist ,
B	but in any case ,
B	the linguistics students and .
B	so my idea on wednesday is partly to
B	you , what you did today would is just fine .
B	you just do " this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's some of the dialogue and . "
B	but then , the other thing is we should give the computer scientists some idea of what 's going on with the system design ,
B	and where we think the belief - nets fit in
B	and where the pieces are and like that .
B	is is this make sense to everybody ?
B	so , don't don't 's worth lot of work , particularly on your part , to to make big presentation .
B	don't think you should
B	you don't have to make any new powerpoint or anything .
B	we got plenty of to talk about .
B	and , then just see how discussion goes .
D	the other two things is
D	we 've can have johno tell us little about this
D	and we also have little bit on the interface ,
D	- three - enhancement ,
D	and then that was it , .
A	so , what did for this is , pedagogical belief - net
A	because was took tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out
A	so what did was took
A	made these dummy nodes called trajector - in and trajector - out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .
A	and then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .
A	and separated them out .
A	and then did similar things for our net to with the context and the discourse and whatnot ,
A	so we could isolate them or whatever in terms of the top layer .
A	and then the bottom layer is just the mode .
B	so , let 's let 's
B	don't understand it .
B	slide all the way up so we see what the very bottom looks like ,
B	or is that it ?
A	there 's just one more node and it says " mode " which is the decision between the
A	so all did was took the last belief - net
A	and grouped things according to what how they would fit in to image schemas that would be related .
A	and the two that came up with were trajector - landmark and then source - path - goal as initial ones .
A	and then said , the trajector would be the person in this case probably .
A	, we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,
A	or they were hurried .
A	that 's related to that .
A	and then in terms of the source , the things the only things that we had on there believe were whether
A	actually , , might have added these cuz don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one
A	but whether the where 'm currently at is landmark might have bearing on whether
A	or the " landmark - iness " of where 'm currently at .
A	and " usefulness " is bass is that an institutional facility like town hall like that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever .
A	" travel constraints " would be something like , maybe they said they can they only wanna take bus like that ,
A	and then those are somewhat related to the path ,
A	so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly .
A	" goal " .
A	similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed
A	and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .
A	and then if you go up ,
A	so , in terms of context , what we had currently said was whether they were businessman or tourist of some other person .
A	discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours
A	or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , along those lines .
A	prosody don't really 'm not really what prosody means , in this context ,
A	so made up whether what they say is or how they say it is that .
A	the parse would be what verb they chose ,
A	and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " need to get there quickly " or whatever .
A	and , in terms of world knowledge , this would just be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .
D	what 's " tourbook " ?
A	that would be , , the " landmark - iness " of things ,
A	whether it 's in the tourbook or not .
B	ch - ch - ch .
B	alright , so understand what 's what you got .
B	don't yet understand how you would use it .
B	so let me see if ask
A	this is not working bayes - net .
B	no , understand that ,
B	let 's slide back up again
B	start at the at the bottom
B	oop - bo - doop - boop .
B	so , you could imagine
B	go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something .
A	say what you were gonna say .
B	good , do it !
B	go do it .
A	'd no , was gonna until
B	so , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into real bayes - net ,
B	that is , , with fill
B	actually , fill it @ @ in , then
A	so we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the mode .
B	that 's an issue .
A	cuz don't understand how it would work otherwise .
B	here 's the problem .
B	and and bhaskara and was talking about this little earlier today
B	is , if we just do this , we could wind up with huge , combinatoric input to the mode thing .
A	unders understand that ,
A	it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .
B	but that 's what we have to do .
B	there there are variety of ways of doing it .
B	let me just mention something that don't want to pursue today
B	which is there are technical ways of doing it ,
B	slipped paper to bhaskara and about noisy - or 's and noisy - maxes
B	there 're ways to back off on the purity of your bayes - net - edness .
B	so . if you co you could ima and
B	now that any of those actually apply in this case ,
B	but there is some technology you could try to apply .
A	so it 's possible that we could do something like summary node of some sort that
A	so in that case , the sum we 'd have we
A	these wouldn't be the summary nodes .
A	we 'd have the summary nodes like
A	where the things were maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other
B	so what was gonna say is maybe good at this point is to try to informally
B	not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .
B	so , if you have some bottom line decision about which mode ,
B	what are the most relevant things .
B	and the other trick , which is not technical trick , it 's knowledge engineering trick , is to make the each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics .
B	so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be ,
B	then you could say " aha , let 's have these three factors " ,
B	and maybe binary version for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .
B	and then the question would be if those are the things that you care about , can you make relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .
B	so that so that , , you can try to do knowledge engineering thing
B	given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use orthodox bayes - nets , then we have knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that .
A	so what need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?
B	" - . "
B	mmm , something .
B	so , robert has thought about this problem for long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around ,
B	so he may have some good intuition about , what are the crucial things .
B	and , , understand where this the
B	this is way of playing with this abs source - path - goal trajector exp abstraction and sh displaying it in particular way .
B	don't think our friends on wednesday are going to be able to
B	maybe they will .
B	let me think about whether we can present this to them or not .
D	this is still , , ad - hoc .
D	this is th the second version and look at this maybe just as , , whatever , uml diagram or , , as just screen shot , not really as bayes - net as john johno said .
A	we could actually , draw it in different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .
D	but the that , it just is is visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified more carefully
B	alright , , le let me think about this some more ,
B	and see if we can find way to present this to this linguists group that is helpful to them .
D	we regard this as an exercise in thinking about the problem
D	and maybe first version of module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask ,
D	that you can give input
D	and it 'll throw the dice for you ,
D	throw the die for you ,
D	because integrated this into the existing smartkom system in the same way as much the same way we can have this this thing .
D	close this down .
D	so if this is what - three - will look like and what it 'll give us ,
D	and very simple thing .
D	we have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .
D	and this these this changed now only ,
D	it 's doing it twice now because it already did it once .
D	we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " approach " and could be , , more refined in many ways .
D	or we can have something where the goal is public place
D	and it will give us then an action type of the type " enter " .
D	so this is just based on this one , on this one feature ,
D	and that 's that 's about all you can do .
D	and so in the
D	if this pla if the object type here is is landmark , it 'll be " vista " .
D	and this is about as much as we can do if we don't if we want to avoid huge combinatorial explosion where we specify " , if it 's this and this but that is not the case " , and , it just gets really messy .
B	you 're you 're
B	it was much too quick for me .
B	so let me see if understand what you 're saying .
B	so , do understand that you can take the - three - and add not and it
B	and you need to do this , for ,
B	we have to add , , not too much about object types and ,
B	and what you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say " if it 's of type " landmark " , then you take you 're gonna take picture of it . "
B	that 's what you do .
B	ev - every landmark you take picture of ,
D	every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .
B	and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing smartkom system .
B	and you just did ,
D	and it would do us no good .
B	so , , and let 's think about this .
B	that 's that 's another baseline case ,
B	that 's another thing " , here 's another minimal way of tackling this " .
B	add extra properties ,
B	deterministic rule for every property
B	you have an action , " pppt ! "
B	you do that .
B	then the question would be
B	now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology ,
B	because that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done .
B	so we don't we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things .
B	alright , but that 's but that 's , and it 's again one minimal extension of the existing things .
B	and that 's something the smartkom people themselves would
B	they 'd say " , that 's no problem
B	no problem to add types to the ont "
D	this is just in order to exemplify what we can do very , very easily is ,
D	we have this silly interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .
D	now , the content
D	whi which is what we see here , which is the vista , schema , source , path , goal , whatever .
D	this will be job to find ways of writing down image schema , - schema , constructions , in some form ,
D	and have this be in in the content ,
D	loosely called " constructicon " .
D	and the rules we want to throw away completely .
D	and and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our bayes - net ,
D	which is exactly getting the input feeding into here .
D	this decides whether it 's an whether action
B	" approach " , you called it , this time .
D	approach construction should be activated , ie just pasted in .
B	that 's what you said
B	that 's fine .
B	but it 's not construction there , it 's action .
B	construction is is different story .
A	so what we 'd be generating would be reference to semantic like parameters for the for the - schema ?
B	if you had the generalized " go " - schema
B	and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .
B	and then , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the gis
B	and use that to actually get , detailed route planning .
B	so , , where do you do take picture of it and like that .
B	but that 's not it 's not the immediate problem .
B	but , presumably that that functionality 's there when we
A	so the immediate problem is just deciding which
D	aspects of the - schema to add .
B	so the pro the immediate problem is back to what you were what you are doing with the belief - net .
B	what are we going to use to make this decision
A	right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?
B	that actually is relatively easy in this case .
B	the harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ?
B	and that the that 's the hardest problem .
B	so , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology .
B	so , that 's the hardest problem at the moment is
B	where are you gonna
B	how are you gonna get this information .
B	and that 's so , getting back to here ,
B	we have technical problem with the belief - nets that we don't want all the com
A	there 's just too many factors right now .
B	too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially .
B	so we wanna think about which ones we really care about
B	and what they really most depend on ,
B	and can we , clean this up to the point where it
A	so what we really wanna do
A	cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna make it expand it out into more layers ?
B	that 's certainly one thing we can do .
B	it 's true that the way you have this , lot of the times you have
B	what you 're having is the values rather than the variable .
A	so instead of in instead it should really be just be " intention " as node instead of " intention business " or " intention tour " .
B	and then it would have values , , " tour " , " business " , or " hurried " .
B	but then but it still some knowledge design to do , about how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .
B	it 's fine .
B	we have to it 's iterative .
B	we 're gonna have to work with it some .
A	what was going through my mind when did it was someone could both have business intention and touring intention
A	the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time
B	you could do that .
B	and it 's perfectly to insist that , , th , they add up to one ,
B	but that there 's that it doesn't have to be one zero .
B	so you could have the conditional
B	the each of these things is gonna be probability .
B	so whenever there 's choice ,
B	so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,
A	see don't think those would be mutually
A	it seems like something could both be
B	and so that you might want to then have those
B	th - then they may have to be separate .
B	they may not be able to be values of the same variable .
B	but again , this is this is the knowledge design you have to go through .
B	it 's , it 's great is , , as one step toward toward where we wanna go .
D	also it strikes me that we may want to approach the point where we can try to find , specification for some interface , here that takes the normal - three - , looks at it .
D	then we discussed in our pre - edu edu meeting how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology
D	the fact that we can pretend we have one , make dummy until we get the real one ,
D	and so we may wanna decide we can do this from here ,
D	but we also could do it if we have belief - net interface .
D	so the belief - net takes as input , vector ,
D	and it output is whatever , as .
D	but this information is just - three - ,
D	and then we want to look up some more in the ontology
D	and we want to look up some more in the
D	maybe we want to ask the real world ,
D	maybe you want to look something up in the grs ,
D	but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history some some .
D	was just made some examples from the ontology
D	and so we have some information there that the town hall is both building and it has doors and like this ,
D	but it is also an institution , so it has mayor and
D	and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history ,
D	" were any of these things that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? " ,
D	" were any of these that make the town hall building mentioned ? " ,
D	and maybe draw some inferences on that .
D	so this may be process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net ,
B	that 's that 's exactly right .
B	there will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for decision process .
B	no that 's that 's just fine .
B	so they 'll they presumably there 'll be thread or process that
B	" agent " , , " agent " , whatever you wan wanna say , ,
B	that is rule - driven , and can can do things like that .
B	and there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and carries out the decision ,
B	so it probably will .
B	my is it 'll be the same basic agent that can go off and get information , run it through this belief - net that
B	turn crank in the belief - net ,
B	that 'll come out with more another vector ,
B	which can then be applied at what we would call the simulation or action end .
B	so you now you 're gonna do
B	and that may actually involve getting more information .
B	so on once you pull that out , it could be that says " !
B	now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . "
B	now that we know that it 's bus trip ,
B	we didn't we didn't need to know beforehand , how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more .
B	so that 's .
D	so this is actually , if we were to build something that is ,
D	and , , had one more thing ,
D	the it needs to do
D	we come up with code for module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing ,
D	but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out ,
D	there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do
D	and then collect sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .
D	so maybe this is actually some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and get this part ,
B	confess , 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story .
B	this this is not complaint , this is promise to do more work .
B	so 'm gonna hafta think about it some more .
B	see what we 'd like to do , and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such way that you get lot of re - use .
B	so . what you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that if about source , paths and goals , and nnn all this , that lot of this is the same , for different tasks .
B	and that there 's there 's some important generalities that you 're getting ,
B	so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it .
B	and don't yet see how that goes .
D	there 're no primitives upon which
B	what are the primitives , and how do you break this
B	so 'm just there saying eee you know how to do any individual case ,
B	see what 's the really interesting question is can you use deep cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations .
D	should we add then the " what 's this ? " domain ?
D	" how do get to " .
D	then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different
D	johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore .
D	so he dislikes the term .
B	don't like the term either , so have
D	but , 'm the " what 's this ? " questions also create some interesting - schema aspects .
B	'm not 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,
B	eventually we 're gonna want whole range of them .
C	that 's right .
B	'm just saying that 'm gonna hafta do some first principles thinking about this .
B	at the moment .
B	no the bayes the bayes - nets
B	the bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision .
B	but what 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different bayes - nets , be the general .
B	so that if you have sources , you have trajectors and like that ,
B	and there 's language for talking about trajectors ,
B	you shouldn't have to do that differently
B	for going to something , than for circling it ,
B	for telling someone else how to go there ,
B	whatever it is .
B	so that , the decision processes are gonna be different
B	what you 'd really like is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have intermediate representation which looks the same over bunch of inputs and bunch of outputs .
B	so all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on .
B	and that 's that would be the really pretty result .
B	and pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with smartkom ,
B	that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's something about the intent
B	the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and ,
B	in independent of whether it about what is this or where is it , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in general way .
B	so that 's the
B	you might be able to
B	say that this this is the construction in which the
B	there 's let 's say there 's cont
B	there the land the construction implies the there 's con this thing is being viewed as container .
B	so just from this local construction that you 're gonna hafta treat it as container you might as go off and get that information .
B	and that may effect the way you process everything else .
B	so if you say " how do get into the castle "
B	or , , " what is there in the castle " or
B	so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as container
B	and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as container , you crank up the appropriate .
B	independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is .
B	alright , so that 's that 's the thesis level
D	it 's unfortunate also that english has got rid of most of its spatial adverbs
D	because they 're really fancy then , in for these kinds of analysis .
B	you have prepositional phrases that
D	but they 're they 're easier for parsers .
D	parsers can pick those up but the with the spatial adverbs , they have tough time .
D	because the mean the semantics are very complex in that .
D	had one more thing .
D	forgot it again .
D	but an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to throw this away and replace it with something else , or whatever ,
D	so that we have so that this is the representational formats we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem ,
D	that generalize over those problems , and are , of higher quality than an any actual whatever belief - net , or " " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately .
D	should be decoupled , .
B	so , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ?
B	'm 'm happy to do that .
B	we we had talked about it , cuz you have th the display and everything , that seems fine .
D	, liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time .
D	don't think we will need to do that but it 's
D	so far it was as visual aid for some things and
B	no it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at .
B	she was good .
B	litonya was good .
D	the , she she was definitely good in the sense that she showed us some of the weaknesses
D	and also the the fact that she was real subject , is
B	and and she took it and
B	no , it was great .
D	looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem ,
D	is , , she actually said , she never just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying .
D	so this is definitely interesting , and
D	and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the at the graffiti ,
D	also , , not in the sentence " how do you get there ? " was pretty standard .
D	except that there was anaphora , , for pointing at what she talked about before ,
D	and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside wall on walls ,
D	actually , you 'd need lot of world knowledge .
D	this would have been classical " tango " , actually .
D	because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside ,
D	so the mistake would have make mistake the system would have made mistake here .
