B	3.68	if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time .	opening
D	15.11	is that someone's ?	opening
B	27.38	you all switched on .	opening
B	32.72	presume we're good to go .	opening
B	33.91	minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor .	opening
B	49.97	we wanted stand-by function .	opening
B	51.94	the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .	opening
B	56.72	buttons with combination of l_c_d_ and rubber according to the design .	opening
B	61.22	bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel .	opening
B	68.12	and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .	opening
B	76.31	and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .	opening
C	91.37	is that for us ?	agenda/equipment issues
B	92.6	that would be you .	agenda/equipment issues
A	94.68	me and william worked on prototype , and william is going to make presentation on that .	agenda/equipment issues
C	102.0	though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation .	agenda/equipment issues
B	103.25	make the camera's yes , yes you can .	agenda/equipment issues
A	103.62	hold it like , so it looks crazy .	agenda/equipment issues
C	108.3	can nick your whoa .	agenda/equipment issues
B	109.95	second , i'll get it out .	agenda/equipment issues
C	116.55	going bit crazy over here .	agenda/equipment issues
B	125.4	you should have one of those things and you can just take it off .	agenda/equipment issues
A	132.1	where are the hinges ?	agenda/equipment issues
C	138.63	so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation .	presentation of prototype(s)
C	144.53	and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there .	look and usability
C	150.93	it's gonna have plastic body with standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like white or light blue .	look and usability
A	153.04	you able to look ?	look and usability
C	165.55	this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .	look and usability
C	178.38	the wide choice of colours and patterns , so you've got you've got lot of customisation with it .	look and usability
C	187.31	it's an clam-shell design and the the top l_c_d_ screen that you can see that would would be how do you say , it's , it would be inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would so so it'll fully close flat .	look and usability
A	204.79	the black and white touch screen wherein people can right .	look and usability
B	209.53	so it's flush .	look and usability
B	214.93	right , , .	look and usability
C	217.71	and working on the inside we've already said decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as , so that you could probably get bit of .	components, materials and energy sources
B	233.26	so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's .	components, materials and energy sources
C	239.93	we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap .	components, materials and energy sources
C	252.72	so you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , i'm here , .	components, materials and energy sources
C	267.23	it wo it won't shout out i'm here .	components, materials and energy sources
C	269.55	it'll just shout out i'm here , to similar effect .	components, materials and energy sources
B	272.37	i'm under the sofa .	components, materials and energy sources
A	274.29	oka infrared could be here also .	components, materials and energy sources
B	274.65	or , that would be too complicated .	components, materials and energy sources
C	275.32	if it was going like tha that could be something for next time , maybe .	components, materials and energy sources
C	281.57	you can have remote that tells you exactly where it is .	components, materials and energy sources
C	284.76	the standard , there's be standard transmission with the t_v_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .	components, materials and energy sources
C	291.74	it would it would have 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some cabling .	components, materials and energy sources
C	304.62	and because , , all t_v_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .	components, materials and energy sources
C	316.57	and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't don't think we actually put it on .	components, materials and energy sources
C	330.8	, something like that .	components, materials and energy sources
B	332.89	actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front .	components, materials and energy sources
C	334.2	on the front on the front side of that , .	components, materials and energy sources
B	336.62	right , , , , i've got you .	components, materials and energy sources
A	337.51	so when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go .	components, materials and energy sources
B	339.8	it's still pointing , yes .	components, materials and energy sources
C	339.9	so when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the t_v_ .	components, materials and energy sources
B	342.35	that would make sense .	components, materials and energy sources
C	343.91	and then finally on to the interface .	look and usability
C	348.01	the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white l_c_d_ touch screen which would have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect .	look and usability
A	356.66	this one right here .	look and usability
C	380.61	and now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some some bezzled logo on it , inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .	look and usability
A	398.96	which is no .	presentation of prototype(s) look and usability
B	399.04	but not interfering with the outside look of the product once it's .	presentation of prototype(s) look and usability
C	400.04	no not not actually .	look and usability
C	402.29	no , not interfering with the whole look of the the product when it's on the thing .	look and usability
A	404.82	look up to it .	presentation of prototype(s)
C	408.67	and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo .	presentation of prototype(s)
B	416.53	wrapping it all up , .	presentation of prototype(s)
B	419.12	i've now got evaluation criteria .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	424.26	so this is the one .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	427.07	it's to be presented .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	428.81	there you go .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	448.34	this is chip .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	452.26	it's quite similar to what it was before , though .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	456.0	this stage of the evaluation is really for us as team to evaluate if we have now got product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	469.75	so this is the first stage of the evaluation .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	472.49	now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	481.58	so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	488.36	now the findings that we came up with , just recap , are here .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	491.16	the criteria that we want in this remote control are fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	508.45	the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having beeper function .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	525.04	so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have note of those .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	528.81	i'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	534.67	we're going to use seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	539.13	we look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned , i'll call that slide back up , and will just do preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	548.94	does that seem clear ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	549.82	any questions there ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	552.41	so we're going to look at these crite yes , we're going to come to we'll discuss each one and we'll come to consensus rating between one and seven .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	553.36	is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	563.05	one is true , seven is false .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	569.32	so won't write all of that out again .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	570.98	it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or a_ , b_ , c_ , d_ , e_ , f_ to confuse it with the number rating .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	577.68	b_ , c_ , d_ , e_ , f_ .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	580.75	this is where realise how tiny actually am .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	584.38	just write small .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	586.32	criteria and rating .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	595.77	actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	600.22	how about that ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	600.95	so you can 'kay .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	602.78	so i'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	617.53	criteria a_ , the fancy look and feel .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	621.47	how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is fancy look and feel .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	626.6	one is true , seven is false .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	628.86	my own rating for that would be two .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	632.52	one is true and seven is false .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	638.7	i'd i'd probably put it two , two or three .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	638.81	i'll just go this way .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	645.68	no , three .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	649.51	would say two .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	653.18	would say four .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	656.09	adding those up , we've got six and five , eleven divided by four is what ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	661.32	two and three quarters , it that right .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	665.51	two and three quarters ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	671.92	two point seven five , there we go .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	674.63	criteria b_ , criterion b_ , technologically innovative .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	680.8	would give that three .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	686.39	i'd give it one .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	688.95	not that you're biased in that it the designer .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	690.05	no , no , not .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	698.92	got it wrong .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	701.23	the first one rating , i'm .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	702.98	can you just make it two ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	705.32	the average , for you ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	706.03	it the other way .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	707.18	you want your rating to be two ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	708.98	in , got two point one is , seven is false , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	710.37	is that what you're saying ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	714.96	so , i'll work out the average for that again at the end .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	716.65	it's very slightly altered , and we're just waiting for your rating two point five , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	721.17	it's just two point five for that one .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	727.55	losing one decimal place , that's .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	730.99	so what are you rating for this one , paw ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	735.81	so that is eight .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	737.34	that brings it down to two , and simple , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	741.55	ease of use .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	743.66	easy to use ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	745.99	based on what you've said there , would say one , true .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	758.53	would say two .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	760.76	would say two .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	766.42	should've said two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	770.76	we'll just put almost two , because i'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	772.44	one point seven five .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	775.66	or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	778.98	now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	795.43	so i'm just thinking , before give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	801.19	that's no , no , the the base colour was white or or like or light blue , but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any any one of number of colours that th it's full customised .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	801.52	is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	806.95	with for the plastic ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	818.61	so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	821.54	, and no , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just hard plastic .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	824.05	and the spongy feel is no problem with that .	evaluation of prototype(s)
A	826.0	because you'll be having because of the rubber case .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	835.01	in that case it's got to be one for me .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	838.01	i'll give it one as .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	844.67	that part was and easy .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	848.03	moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	854.99	don't think we've really touched on that lot .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	856.94	we've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	863.09	we've talked about pointers , but the very use of remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such small device ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	871.36	the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises r_s_i_ it's meant to .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	875.92	it's meant to be .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	878.89	maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of we're putting on it isn't that much .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	888.55	so maybe because there's more space , it's not moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	895.72	it's quite obvious just big buttons .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	899.81	i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it four .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	905.59	i'd i'd i'd go for five , actually , 'cause .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	911.94	four and four .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	917.63	twenty one is that twenty one ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	919.65	so that's four point two five .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	925.61	and finally , last but not least , easy to locate .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	929.47	now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	934.54	it was it was voice voice recognition , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	937.33	it was the i'm here thing , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	940.33	and are we happy with the costs on that ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	942.37	that is going to be feasible , cost-wise .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	942.76	, that , that's feasible .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	945.46	that sounds good then .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	946.41	i'd go for ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on t_v_ .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	951.26	it would it would probably be stand it would be stand it would be quite loud .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	952.16	so if sombody's in the other room or if t_v_s in different rooms , or .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	961.48	it would be .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	962.44	so it would be .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	963.24	you built into the feature .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	963.83	and if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	970.72	that's one for me .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	972.8	one and one , good .	evaluation of prototype(s)
C	977.66	do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but thin , .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	983.12	so , how do we feel about this ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	985.82	we've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	995.08	that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1001.02	the lowest rating we've got , which is really it's not terribly low , it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1011.19	do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1023.43	we happy to go ahead ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1026.9	for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	1037.85	do much apart from having huge big don't .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1042.79	hope that's clear to the team .	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1045.0	is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before sum up ?	evaluation of prototype(s)
D	1053.57	i'll just leave it there .	evaluation of prototype(s)
B	1064.69	i've got finance here now .	costing
B	1067.22	i'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's .	costing
A	1078.78	you want me to unplug that ?	costing
B	1112.62	now presume that the screen will go blank , that .	costing
B	1126.68	we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value .	costing
B	1132.01	so are we still on for kinetic ?	costing
B	1137.15	see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .	costing
B	1139.95	it might have influenced our choice .	costing
B	1145.1	right , what's happening with the electronics ?	costing
C	1148.35	it was regular chip on print and , no , no , no , the , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .	costing
A	1150.01	chip on print .	costing
C	1168.02	in the top , it's the number of .	costing
C	1174.66	and , just no , one reg , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .	costing
B	1175.2	so , would there be two ?	costing
C	1188.18	and they're double curved .	costing
C	1190.84	two , 'cause it's two .	costing
B	1191.3	one double curve .	costing
A	1193.71	two curves , .	costing
D	1194.81	but it has slightly flattened bottom so it can sit .	costing
D	1196.93	so it can rest .	costing
B	1197.3	so what's single curve then ?	costing
C	1198.5	i'd say i'd say it was , it's one double-curved .	costing
D	1199.33	it would just be flat bottom with one curve .	costing
D	1201.68	like domed thing .	costing
B	1202.88	so just one double .	costing
C	1206.93	and one no , 'cause one , one's double-curved , and then the other one's plastic .	costing
A	1207.73	plastic and rubber .	costing
D	1210.63	the other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over .	costing
B	1216.97	we've got plastic and rubber , haven't we ?	costing
A	1221.78	plastic one and maybe rubber point five .	costing
C	1223.18	and special colour .	costing
A	1227.56	no rubber , since it's being used just as casing , we can put point five .	costing
B	1227.88	do you think ?	costing
A	1233.49	because there are it allows the point five , .	costing
A	1238.0	we can use that .	costing
D	1240.69	what does it mean if you put point five for that ?	costing
A	1242.52	it means we are not using lot of rubber actually .	costing
A	1244.6	we're using just very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .	costing
B	1244.84	it would be like saying we're using see , it says case material .	costing
B	1253.86	so we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?	costing
C	1257.14	no , no , that's it's as an extra .	costing
B	1258.43	it's including , it's including .	costing
C	1260.45	so that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .	costing
D	1267.28	but it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?	costing
D	1271.72	there's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .	costing
D	1274.85	so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?	costing
B	1278.4	we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .	costing
B	1283.57	or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .	costing
B	1289.38	no , we don't step on anyone's toes .	costing
B	1292.2	special colour , do we need that ?	costing
D	1294.34	might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .	costing
C	1304.21	the push-button's one and l_c_ display one .	costing
C	1311.34	and buttons yes .	costing
B	1311.8	buttons has that not gone up ?	costing
D	1370.74	has that not made any if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?	costing
A	1371.93	we could change the battery also .	costing
A	1373.58	instead of going for kinetic how about going for standard battery .	costing
D	1382.24	is it , it's brought it slightly down .	costing
B	1383.15	no , it was seven five it's changed not lot .	costing
D	1386.26	so is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make difference ?	costing
A	1391.61	uncurved , flat .	costing
D	1395.63	it's not made any difference , has it? .	costing
C	1397.52	no , we'll have no , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .	costing
D	1397.85	it's gone up again .	costing
A	1397.89	no , it just surprises one .	costing
B	1398.63	it's not calculated it .	costing
B	1402.8	there we go .	costing
D	1403.87	it's brought it down slightly .	costing
C	1405.18	it might you might you might be assuming that that is in euros .	costing
B	1405.34	it's not lot though .	costing
C	1410.65	it could be in dollars .	costing
C	1412.79	and then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .	costing
D	1416.36	is there anything on the menu no .	costing
B	1416.42	we haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , , so the highest we've got is the electronics here .	costing
A	1419.89	ri it's in euro .	costing
B	1425.41	and the interface .	costing
D	1427.47	if we tr .	discussion
D	1429.88	if we moved away from our much loved idea of kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make huge difference ?	discussion
A	1433.73	and going to regular bat .	discussion
C	1436.48	the standard , it it would make one difference .	discussion
C	1440.16	the biggest one would be taking away if you took away if you to .	discussion
A	1444.22	what feel is , customers never said anything about the battery .	discussion
A	1446.89	it's internal , nobody looks into the battery .	discussion
A	1449.39	but shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi where's that special form ?	discussion
D	1450.29	and people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say i'm not getting this , 'cause i've got to buy battery for remote control .	discussion
C	1450.99	if if you take away the voice , do don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .	discussion
D	1461.66	should we see what difference it makes ?	discussion
B	1462.96	where's the where's the voice recognition ?	discussion
C	1464.18	no 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .	discussion
C	1468.69	if you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .	discussion
B	1472.12	the kinetic is three .	discussion
B	1473.61	if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three .	discussion
C	1475.4	they , but you minus three plus two .	discussion
B	1480.79	keep seeing zero .	discussion
B	1483.56	we can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition .	discussion
B	1493.09	we could do the voice recognition for , , business class , , like an upgraded version .	discussion
B	1500.37	you could choose to have that or not .	discussion
C	1501.54	but they but in don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .	discussion
D	1511.8	but we're still working to head we can put in our recommendations .	discussion
B	1513.26	so should we just change the design specification then ?	discussion
A	1516.96	make it costly .	discussion
D	1517.1	if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as result of the meetings .	discussion
C	1526.84	we we could , we could say , and then say we recommend .	discussion
D	1527.56	but we need to work to that specification to start with .	discussion
D	1530.37	and the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as in first instance .	discussion
D	1539.81	as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so .	discussion
B	1544.93	we can make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd .	discussion
D	1555.06	'cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .	discussion
B	1556.25	they like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different .	discussion
B	1560.26	it's something completely different associated with your company .	discussion
B	1563.47	right , , so it's two point five .	costing discussion
D	1565.4	so if we take voice recognition out we are .	costing
C	1567.94	that'll do it .	costing
C	1570.6	twelve point three five .	costing
A	1572.23	we are close to the budget .	costing
C	1573.89	is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?	costing
B	1577.21	no , it's twelve point two five .	costing
D	1580.71	not meaning to doubt your words there .	costing
B	1581.9	two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , isn't it ?	costing
D	1587.47	are they really going to quibble about ten p_ ?	costing
A	1588.0	it's twelve point five maybe , then .	costing
D	1591.45	or point zero one of euro ?	costing
D	1594.56	which is less than ten p_ .	costing
A	1601.5	what it said fifty percent of the cost .	costing
A	1604.73	so half of the price would be it is the first one .	costing
B	1604.82	the agenda one was where the price was , wasn't it ?	costing
D	1614.53	that's today's kick off meeting , .	costing
B	1622.62	twelve point five .	costing
A	1624.72	so we are under the budget .	costing
D	1625.01	that's what it was .	costing
B	1626.45	done , people .	costing
B	1630.89	so is that got us covered for the electronics then ?	costing
B	1634.18	we don't need something else to take that place ?	costing
C	1637.76	'cause that that was just bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , .	costing
A	1655.8	except voice recognition , everything is .	costing evaluation of project process
B	1657.33	right , so we've done that .	costing
B	1666.92	we've done room for creativity , haven't we ?	evaluation of project process
B	1669.48	because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make .	evaluation of project process
B	1675.13	presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .	evaluation of project process
B	1685.36	in the sense that did you feel like team ?	evaluation of project process
B	1691.88	or did you feel like autonomy ?	evaluation of project process
C	1695.04	i'd say , as team .	evaluation of project process
D	1696.56	although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other .	evaluation of project process
A	1697.03	we had time .	evaluation of project process
C	1701.17	find out from each other , .	evaluation of project process
D	1703.15	and i've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .	evaluation of project process
A	1713.31	there was very constructive feedback by everybody .	evaluation of project process
A	1717.14	it's not like people trying to cut each other .	evaluation of project process
A	1720.27	there is more of true cohesive teamwork .	evaluation of project process
A	1722.18	we came to very predic creative design , .	evaluation of project process
A	1729.64	and sarah , you coordinated the work very .	evaluation of project process
B	1732.96	how did you find it ?	evaluation of project process
C	1734.64	no , it it went really and , feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good .	evaluation of project process
C	1753.66	it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , maybe it would've come out little different , but .	evaluation of project process
B	1768.32	liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , , it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field .	evaluation of project process
B	1790.6	you two created that wonderful specimen of play-doh model .	evaluation of project process
A	1795.96	that was the best part of the 'kay .	evaluation of project process
B	1795.96	i'm still not caught up .	evaluation of project process
B	1802.5	but that's nothing to do with the teamwork .	evaluation of project process
D	1806.77	maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as side line .	evaluation of project process
D	1812.83	and fake r_c_s .	evaluation of project process
B	1814.44	no , that was quite fun .	evaluation of project process
B	1815.97	means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ?	evaluation of project process
D	1820.59	how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?	evaluation of project process
C	1821.29	discuss which ones .	evaluation of project process
D	1826.9	could it've been better , was it adequate ?	evaluation of project process
C	1829.63	we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more .	evaluation of project process
B	1835.62	had time to , 'cause we could just say , what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , .	evaluation of project process
B	1848.42	but it was having it there .	evaluation of project process
B	1851.03	like the whole picture of the thing .	evaluation of project process
A	1854.16	moving around the room .	evaluation of project process
A	1857.17	but it's good , like we spent times individually .	evaluation of project process
A	1894.74	never thought of remote control with flip top .	evaluation of project process
B	1899.96	it's new ideas in general , rather than .	evaluation of project process
D	1900.85	it's really borrowing from other areas , it's , , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's nothing is new , but it's applying it to in different area .	evaluation of project process
A	1916.64	it's the thing is , , go on sarah .	evaluation of project process
B	1917.09	they have to come from somewhere , don't they ?	evaluation of project process
B	1920.2	and as sh as , you go .	evaluation of project process
B	1922.99	as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly .	evaluation of project process
B	1931.97	they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's something we should think about , but no one's put any great deal of thought into it .	evaluation of project process
C	1940.12	do don't think the the companies are really concerned .	evaluation of project process
C	1944.51	they're just like we've got d_v_d_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ?	evaluation of project process
C	1949.29	can't you get the one that we used for the last one ?	evaluation of project process
C	1952.22	just jazz it up bit .	evaluation of project process
C	1954.47	they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship .	evaluation of project process
C	1959.53	they're trying to ship the d_v_d_ player , the video player , the t_v_ .	evaluation of project process
D	1960.07	the focus isn't on to that , .	evaluation of project process
B	1961.76	but then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , if you could have something that's proper funky thing , funky item that's individual , individual to you , they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay lot extra , because it's individually being plastic was being made for you .	evaluation of project process
B	1992.06	but people could have anything that they wanted .	evaluation of project process
A	1996.81	surprising to me is like people give lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like real want to see new launch like that .	evaluation of project process
B	1997.12	because of the produ .	evaluation of project process
A	2006.13	and new television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this .	evaluation of project process
D	2011.08	it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , this is the first change in remote control devices that really , , say is is obvious and visible .	evaluation of project process
A	2011.18	like sarah was telling , everything's right .	evaluation of project process
D	2024.07	we see it in mobile phones lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed lot of our ide our ideas from .	evaluation of project process
D	2028.51	there are innovations in that that people don't really want .	evaluation of project process
D	2031.37	see people wanting model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and it's wonderful our company's so r_ and d_ based .	evaluation of project process
B	2039.73	it's innovation for money's sake .	evaluation of project process
B	2043.08	the the people have to keep buying .	evaluation of project process
D	2044.21	but forcing it onto people , .	evaluation of project process
D	2045.79	it's things that , , they might want to buy the thing they really want .	evaluation of project process
B	2048.06	and you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that .	evaluation of project process
D	2054.57	or there isn't cover to fit it or whatever , .	evaluation of project process
B	2059.04	in closing there we go .	evaluation of project process
D	2059.06	see it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone .	evaluation of project process
B	2066.19	our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but , what do you think ?	evaluation of project process
B	2075.14	do you think that's takes into account overheads like us being paid thing ?	evaluation of project process
B	2084.72	and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?	evaluation of project process
C	2091.18	that was just the the physical .	evaluation of project process
B	2093.12	so it looks looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that .	evaluation of project process
B	2099.95	so maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .	evaluation of project process
A	2105.59	maybe fifty percent more .	evaluation of project process
C	2105.88	don't from the market research .	evaluation of project process
B	2106.24	but but you were saying that that's quite .	evaluation of project process
D	2108.55	but in the remit that we were given , it was very specific .	evaluation of project process
D	2111.2	we've done what we were required to do , and there'll have to be another project team or new project for us to look at at those things .	evaluation of project process
D	2117.81	don't think that's something we have to look at and find way of raising the cash for .	evaluation of project process
C	2123.27	it was it's top secret .	evaluation of project process
D	2123.99	we've done very to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that people are really gonna want .	evaluation of project process
B	2133.17	it's shame it won't ever get made .	evaluation of project process
B	2136.46	maybe it will .	evaluation of project process
D	2136.49	maybe it will .	evaluation of project process
D	2136.93	maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it .	evaluation of project process
B	2137.44	maybe someone'll run down and patent it .	evaluation of project process
C	2139.94	it's it is it's conspiracy going on here .	evaluation of project process
B	2142.71	the project has been evaluated and truly .	closing
C	2142.79	that's what it is .	evaluation of project process
B	2147.36	and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .	closing
A	2151.4	there's final questionnaire .	closing
B	2152.14	so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that fell behind with , so i'll be delegating in my role as project supervisor , so good luck .	closing
A	2167.51	celebration , you didn't talk about that .	closing
B	2169.54	the celebration is the twenty five pounds .	closing
B	2172.88	either that or we'll be dancing on the desks .	closing
C	2183.5	is that it then ?	closing
B	2184.79	just the last , .	closing
B	2192.06	i've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .	closing
D	2200.84	didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .	closing
C	2204.6	was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ?	closing
D	2211.51	but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ?	closing
C	2215.43	questionnaire seven was the one did just before the meeting .	closing
