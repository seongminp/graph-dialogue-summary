A	297.92	don't gonna explain it all , because how it works .	introduction to tools and equipment
A	303.87	we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved .	introduction to tools and equipment
A	311.39	we we may not delete anything .	introduction to tools and equipment
A	313.42	so if you have drawn something , save it .	introduction to tools and equipment
A	316.7	never delete it .	introduction to tools and equipment

D	864.72	i'm gonna design remote remote control animal .	drawing exercise
B	867.13	remote control animal .	drawing exercise
B	878.17	with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .	drawing exercise
D	887.45	that that might be easier .	drawing exercise
D	888.57	but at the other hand , pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and it's easier to draw .	drawing exercise
A	897.53	better to draw with with but what is he ?	drawing exercise
D	899.21	with pen than with mouse mouse .	drawing exercise

A	939.54	finishing touch and then we're going further .	drawing exercise
D	945.97	have you been counting the time ?	drawing exercise
C	947.38	where does the pen go ?	drawing exercise
C	948.13	just figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive .	drawing exercise
D	956.87	let's go on then .	drawing exercise
A	961.34	the dog is the the most artistic .	drawing exercise
A	967.91	don't choose for youself .	drawing exercise
A	970.11	now we're gonna dig into the to the serious .	project budget
D	970.6	it's pretty abstract .	project budget
A	974.72	the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and half euro .	project budget
A	985.8	so from my point of view , don't t's gonna be very very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and half euro .	project budget
A	1000.97	the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro .	project budget
A	1009.18	so that's lot .	project budget
A	1009.89	we have to sell lot of when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .	project budget
B	1011.51	how much is it ?	project budget
D	1012.37	like how much ?	project budget
B	1012.97	hundred million remotes ?	project budget
C	1020.71	two million , , two million .	project budget
A	1022.23	but our marketing range is , market range is international .	project budget
A	1026.02	so we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our remotes to .	project budget
A	1033.28	at least that countries which have television .	project budget
A	1040.46	so now it's time for us to going to discuss little things .	discussion
A	1047.06	you can think about experience with remote control yourself , at home .	discussion
A	1052.24	what you think might be useful new feature .	discussion
A	1056.57	what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .	discussion
A	1062.72	so let's let's discuss little .	discussion
A	1067.6	i'm gonna join you at the table .	discussion
A	1072.43	what what's the most important thing at remote control ?	look and usability
B	1077.74	the most important thing of remote control is that you can switch channels .	look and usability
B	1083.14	and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .	look and usability
B	1087.4	is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?	look and usability
A	1087.69	so not not remote control who which can can be used for television and d_v_d_ and radio and or just only if you have them on .	look and usability
D	1098.73	but have some points .	look and usability
D	1100.01	can show them on the on the big screen ?	look and usability
A	1118.79	in case you want it this is dead fly .	look and usability
A	1122.76	between the the the , , the the , be the screens .	look and usability
A	1132.11	no no no .	look and usability
A	1132.72	only all the drawings go there , at the left , that pen drawings .	look and usability
B	1136.92	but which the ones we made on the , only in word , .	look and usability
A	1142.05	no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there .	look and usability
D	1150.02	have some points from marketing point of view .	look and usability
D	1153.44	just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap .	look and usability
D	1160.3	it's pretty cheap , twenty five euros .	look and usability
D	1165.07	it doesn't have to matter which brand your t_v_ or other thing is .	look and usability
D	1175.91	i'll wrap it up quickly .	look and usability
D	1177.67	personally has to be multi-purpose .	look and usability
D	1181.91	most of the remote remote controls are just for one purpose .	look and usability
D	1187.35	and by making it multi-purpose , it has new feature , adds new feature to the market , and distinguish from from current products .	look and usability
D	1197.82	maybe some other technology than infrared .	look and usability
D	1201.38	rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you can't switch it .	look and usability
D	1209.5	think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .	look and usability
D	1216.01	that might be little bit expensive .	look and usability
D	1219.2	and something like an l_c_d_ screen .	look and usability
B	1224.84	for what purpose ?	look and usability
D	1226.26	like said here maybe it's easy .	look and usability
D	1231.42	it's as an added feature feature , that , when you're on certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d_ screen what programmes are coming up or from my point of view , .	look and usability
A	1242.37	so it be multi-purpose very technically high remote ?	look and usability
A	1251.29	it must be really innovative , technical-wise ?	look and usability
D	1255.25	it has to be , our company is very good in making new innovative things .	look and usability
A	1268.07	so , agree with you .	look and usability
D	1268.83	so to the current market .	discussion
B	1268.96	we and and the price .	discussion
A	1269.79	so we must focus on things who are really really add something to to .	discussion
D	1277.38	look , you got some cheap remote controls there .	discussion
D	1282.09	they just , you got dozen of 'em .	discussion
D	1287.36	but when you enter new market with remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , .	discussion
A	1299.38	but we have to keep an eye that it's at the beginning of such project , it's it's it's very to talk about , , this would be , that would be .	discussion
A	1310.05	but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly .	discussion
D	1317.91	but it's but but this is just from marketing aspect .	discussion
D	1322.55	anything about user interface or design .	discussion
A	1326.79	and that's because we have him .	discussion
C	1328.84	and and him .	discussion
A	1332.84	next meeting will start in thirty minutes .	closing
A	1335.94	so you will have individual actions where presume will be some feedback , via the the mail .	closing
A	1345.95	the the the industrial designer has to look at the working design .	closing
A	1354.76	the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions .	closing
A	1359.87	so that's the thing we discussed .	closing
B	1361.09	one thing , we must first agree on what we're going to going to make .	agenda/equipment issues
B	1366.88	do we are we going to use it it for multiple systems ?	agenda/equipment issues
B	1371.05	or we should have some agreement on that before we .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1375.89	don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1380.19	th that's pha .	agenda/equipment issues
C	1382.88	figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1386.01	that's phase further .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1387.91	ju just make some mock-ups , some some general ideas .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1395.12	and and then we can plan .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1400.84	we can plan further , .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1404.34	but maybe , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we must have little or kinda how do you call it ?	agenda/equipment issues
B	1418.07	consensus on the , what we're gonna do .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1418.17	little plan on on what we're going to do .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1422.23	so you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1431.04	some basic things we co we want to going to do .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1437.64	will come in handy .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1444.85	you're the project manager .	agenda/equipment issues
B	1447.33	if the technical functions have to be designed , i've gotta know for what machines they will be .	agenda/equipment issues
B	1453.01	or do we use it text screen ?	agenda/equipment issues
B	1454.9	or will it be with with bluetooth or .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1457.89	th that's that's really step further .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1460.27	but if you say is it one way or multi-purpose , that's why ?	agenda/equipment issues
D	1466.3	tha that's same step further .	agenda/equipment issues
C	1468.6	actually it is .	agenda/equipment issues
C	1471.31	then looking at individual components , so that's actually step further .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1475.44	like we all have list of things that has to that have to be in it , or how it has to be like .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1482.67	and then in the next meeting we decide what it's gonna be .	agenda/equipment issues
C	1486.31	we can take it from there .	agenda/equipment issues
C	1487.8	agree , we can take it from there .	agenda/equipment issues
D	1488.5	and then you then you can delete the the obsolete details .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1496.18	so each individually individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1505.41	and then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting .	agenda/equipment issues
A	1511.67	must finish off now , so it's over .	closing
A	1513.29	you will receive specific specific instructions by your personal coach .	closing
