The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting.
The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces.
The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting.
She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control.
She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip.
The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote.
Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable.
The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly.
They about the power source and review the objectives of the product.
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete.
The marketing expert will do the product evaluation.
The industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay.
The industrial designer will come up with a user interface design.
Their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions.
They decided that the product should be bright, colorful, trendy in design, strong, compact, have push buttons, and contain supplement features (possibly mute button, swapping button, voice recognition).
The power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective.
They will have the industrial engineer do more research on the cost of voice recognition before deciding whether to include that function.
The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature, but they are not sure about how much it would cost.
This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
