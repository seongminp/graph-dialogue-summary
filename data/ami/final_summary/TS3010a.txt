For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings.
The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform.
They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators.
They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote.
They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.
