The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype, and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition.
The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype.
He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions.
The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design.
A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design.
The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design.
They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition.
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype, and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting.
The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will construct a prototype for the product.
The group will evaluate the prototype according to whether or not it meets the requirements of users.
The group decided on the features that will be incorporated into the design of the prototype.
The remote will be shaped and colored like a banana, and be covered in a spongy material.
The buttons will be lighted.
The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost.
It will be placed at the top of the banana shape.
