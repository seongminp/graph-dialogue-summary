The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen.
Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria.
The overall rating was two.
The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros.
The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.
Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.
Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
*NA*
The remote will have an LCD screen.
The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick.
The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour.
There was some confusion about the agenda.
The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed.
Which features should be removed or changed.
Which chip would be needed for the revised design.
