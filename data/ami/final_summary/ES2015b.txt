The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first.
The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials.
To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled.
The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote.
The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget.
The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users.
She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex.
The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group.
They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting.
