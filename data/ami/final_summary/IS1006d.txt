This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.
It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
It was designed to be powered by a single battery.
The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.
The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
*NA*
After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.
When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.
The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.
Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.
The prototype was more than 40% over budget.
The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
