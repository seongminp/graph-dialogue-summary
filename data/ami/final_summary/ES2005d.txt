The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group.
Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons.
It also featured scroll wheels for channel control.
The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind.
The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead.
It was decided that another feature could possibly be added.
The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership.
The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.
The remote will come in several designs: two will have different fruit or vegetable shapes, one of which will feature speech recognition in lieu of a large number of buttons.
There will also be a child-friendly banana-shaped remote.
Both the company name and slogan will appear on the remote.
The remotes will be bundled with a yellow charging stand.
The devices were made with a latex product with a rubbery texture.
It was decided that the product had met enough of the initial project goals to be launched on the market.
The Project Manager felt that the group had been too constrained by the budget.
Some felt that the banana shape would not appeal to enough of the market and that there was not enough variety in shape in the remotes to make up for this problem.
