The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda.
The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango.
They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible.
They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme.
The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7.
The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto.
They average the scores and get 1.9.
They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros.
In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had.
They close the meeting by thanking one another.
