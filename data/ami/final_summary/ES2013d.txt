The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting.
The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design.
The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons.
The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology.
The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability.
Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation.
The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote.
The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget.
