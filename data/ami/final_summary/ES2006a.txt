The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda.
She explains the project, which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
The three components of completing the project will be functional, conceptual, and detailed design.
They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name, role, drawing their favorite animal, and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal.
After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have.
They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional.
They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting.
The marketing expert will work on user requirements specification.
The interface specialist will look at the working design.
The industrial designer will work on the technical functions design.
They will get specific instructions when they get back to their workspace.
They will sell the remotes for twenty five Euros each.
They will aim for a profit of fifty million Euros.
The remotes will target the international market.
The group got the idea of making a menu-based remote that would require very few buttons to operate.
Although this is an original idea, one group member points out that may be too innovative and users could have difficulty learning how to operate it.
They did not yet come to a decision about whether this idea should be implemented.
