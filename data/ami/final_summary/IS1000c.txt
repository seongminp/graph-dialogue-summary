Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda.
Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends.
She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive.
She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate.
She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens.
The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms.
He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote.
They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions.
The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip.
They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other.
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting.
The marketing expert will look for the cost inventories of other devices, such as speech recognition.
She will also start evaluating the team's work if possible.
The industial and interface designer will work together on the two prototypes (one cost-effective and one higher-end).
They will recieve further instructions by email.
They decide that the keys on the remote should be smooth, big, and there should not be too many.
They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip, so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise.
