and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
, so the remote control functions .

, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed
But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out
and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .

if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite chunky
and then you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller
just their general use of the remote control ,
Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ,
, current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room ,
those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems .
so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves ,
Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control
so many remote controls look identical ,

I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view
and our starting point with marketing is always market research .
Anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good .
so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .

we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .
But , general T_V_ controls do video as .
you bu som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?
or are we definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,
it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,

so again a big design issue there .
the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons ,
not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons ,
because the controller was physically to big
u , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them ,

and it's general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare

And to summarise I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button
Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls
So in overall a simple and user-friendly design .
But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible

reducing the size of the control
so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control .
if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers
we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate .

the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control ,

Our findings , lots of findings ,
Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .

because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons
, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
, you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,
, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons ,
fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that .
and that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons ,
but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons ,
and it's recorded that it's going to be on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth

But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it ,
I'm thinking young , office people ,
because people in Japan wouldn't buy it
And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
they have a greater population than us young people ,
we are focusing on a mid-range , business class type people .
So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a ornament

presented by me , the Industrial Designer extraordinaire .
What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ?
And then I was just had a quick look at the external design
but I d I left that mostly to the interface designer .
So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics
What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back .
something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design ,
even though we're using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic ,

so it's not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .
The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls ,
So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
Rechargeable with a docking station .

the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition ,
again that was to aid in when they've lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition .
Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?

and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_
which is suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_
which would , when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver ,
which means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using
So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_
and if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .
maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_
if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards
The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?

At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing ,
Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , .

and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on
without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,

because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons
and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard
because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that .
if there's any more information email you extra details ,
so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button
you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others .
And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on
if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could
these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface .
It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .

all age groups from fifteen upwards
but that's quite a high proportion of our , , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .
, that trend reverses in the older age groups .
and in the older age group it reverses ,
So you can see how the yes no varies across the age group there ,
and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group ,
so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups ,
Do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later .
If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
Can run this past you while it occurs to me ,
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that's what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with their design features ,

it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we'll take a feedback from the marketing
further market research will be needed to focus on what that is ,
and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market .
it's the user interface design that may and th the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
you're desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market .
We could focus on the biggest market .
for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , , not waste money , not be profligate
What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?

so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps
and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .
Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ?
And we've talked about there being an alarm , a beeping for being lost , .

, F_N_ function F_ eight .
main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top
they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .
That was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it

so it has obvious design implications there .
, but quite , , easily labelled so that anyone can that's obvious what that's for
Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles ,
so putting it down in words should be helpful .

and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public ,
that's just general fear of new technology .
and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations ,
because they're c just generally Japanese people have smaller hands
and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations .
Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger ,
Or shall generally look the issues involved ?

We discussed a flip-open design ,
So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The
if you ask me personally , I would make flip-top with a trendy design
you could put a logo in the corner of the model ,

, a device which just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state ,
whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .

and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that .
and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body
so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five
The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature ,

So , I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one .
thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use
but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not if you're going to , you put the number in
it lasts a long time once it is charged .
and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .

instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .
but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
And it also paid lip service in the instruction manual ,
and the I the instruction manual , I if we deal with that , .

in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , .
Slightly curved , curved .

not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , .
because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots of pages .
I don't wanna big box with lots of things ,

, slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury .
when you read the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough ,
, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .
because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple ,
and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think .

, most of them are powered by some form of battery .
because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries
You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
Now the main components I came up with were the power source for the batteries
we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the U_I_ interface

We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that s thing .
it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base ,
so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production
with that we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also ,
the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now .
it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .

Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote
so when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing
but what about , , we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers
, maybe to as it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .

they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in .
as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later
Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like ,

But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract
there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to
for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,
they're specially made for the mobile phones ,
th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night ,
Or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias .

Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service
so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?

so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .
it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing ,
it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty
t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , .
it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa

, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .
presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless
Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres
And then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost
so all the components that I've put forward are low in cost
So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience

but on that again thought you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let where it is
we're talking about the type of company that we're working for as .
, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,
they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .
so they the companies who who you deal with have actually they've got an obligation to help you out

, and d which leads onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .
I'm not even confident that those are the real the real way you'd wire it up but anyway ,
because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have ,
. Actually some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,
but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that

so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end ,
now there's I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,

I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,
the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate .
that is still a a question mark issue how we deal with that .

What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , ,
but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that
rather than , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
that's that sounds a really attractive idea ,

try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
we used our usability lab , the company's usability lab ,
this may have to be postponed to a future meeting

I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another ,
Can quickly go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .

so it's like you can say a banana shape thing , curled up like a boat .
the way you h hold of it's semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .
, if it was a C_ like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up like a shell , ,
to hold in the palm of the hand
we can do a conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
