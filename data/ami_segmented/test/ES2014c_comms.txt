just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .
Right , so shape of buttons simple .

if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case ,
It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as as buttons .
one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .
it's if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons .
If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it .
Rubber buttons require rubber case .
, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
and then have the standard rubber buttons as .
And the rubber push buttons , rubber case .
Rubber buttons and case .
That's ru rubber buttons , .

For the buttons , we have an integrated push button ,
so for the buttons there's an integrated push button ,
And note that the push button just requires a simple chip ,
So maybe just a simple push button ,
Simple push button .

The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board .
So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ?
if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .
so we'd have a simple circuit board
so we'd stick with the simple circuit board
Simple circuit board .
Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ?

but it does affect the printed circuit board .
and I that would require a more advanced circuit board ,
with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
but then we for whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .
I suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .
So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .
did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected
and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board .

for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the workings of the actual of the remote .
and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote .

So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button .
so if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time
As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,
the scroll wheel required the regular ,
but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip ,

there's a scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down ,
for the buttons , we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .
So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board .
, and if we're going for sleek and sexy , a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ?
I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there ,
the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those ,

but the feel of the material should be spongy ,
Was that in the fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that fashion ?
And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .
So we've got spongy feel buttons as , have we ?
so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons .

where they just had a very limited range of buttons
Limited number of buttons .
I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual

We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .
This says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer .
the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up ,
whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .

one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use ,

So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg ,
And then even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote ,
if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .
you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons ,
I maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment ,
We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .
I whether it's one of those things that like having all fruit shaped keys , that probably would go out of fashion very quickly ,
And then are we going for one button shaped like a fruit . Or veg .
an apple would be a good recognisable shape .
so what shape are we making the standby button ?

Conceptual design meeting .
For the components design , next step is
there was a mention just as a warning about button design .
so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?
Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment ,
are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ?

And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .
because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function .
the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .
The most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional .
so perhaps fewer buttons and functions as we've discussed .
And I would've thought the functionality the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions .
th that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .
and the general function of the remote would stay the same ,

but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much .
From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy .
some of the remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions .
Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , .
So maybe the children's remote should be like a next step ,
and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes
but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .
that we'd asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used .
where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .
or otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .

And then have to change all change everything at the last minute .
That means you're constantly changing your production schedule ,
The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ?
You're just changing one aspect like the standby button like that ,
Maybe we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions
Change case colour .

like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .
but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .
it seems to make sense that we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case ,
one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other

one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition .
if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing .
The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . .
and then think of the speech recognition as an extra possibility .
I had speech recognition requires advanced
Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple .
So you also said for going for the international market that some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition .

and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a finding your lost control
we're to go for the international market rather than a local market
Right , I've been looking at some trends in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market
but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,
it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .
And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .
and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?

I th the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons ,
I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost
And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product .

so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it
so that in a sense , with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so on would be a white casing .
And the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from a white casing product .

There's a small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost ,
so there is an extra price in that sense .
There is th an extra cost in that sense .
I assume it would cost extra ,
Anyway you could add on for an extra package ,
and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .

but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .
which could be our find the thing with a hand clap .
And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we capture people's imaginations .

I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .
And we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .
So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the fashion trends .
And , the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .
do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget ,
If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases

The display requires an advanced chip
the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .
but we have to take all el elements into consideration .
And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S

Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than hard plastic .
whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , .

but there's some curved cases that you can see , a range of sizes .
But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .
but you can see some of them have got bulges , like the second one and the end one where there's a curve there .
I if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?
But it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there .
Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?
curved or double curved ? So it's single curved .

Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ?

that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time .
And j , just keeping the the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as .

Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device .
But we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , aren't we ?
You could have your company badge and logo .
with the mobiles , it's the , it's a communication device ,
and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,

So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,
and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were .
and then make the decision at that point in time .

So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume ,
So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .
they might see , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down ,
So maybe we could have volume written on the side

So yes including the power s supply as .
first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,
just to say all these are supplied by Real Reaction .
going to my personal preferences , possibly for power we could use kinetic
You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .
So did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?

where it can control four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio .
So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation .
we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else .
Whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a packaging box that does that .

which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement
you move the remote around to power it up .
It's it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside .
It's it's some on watches which you you shake to power it up .
Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .

a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted ,
and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements .
So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .

I presume it must have been not spongy last year .
If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .
if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is is last year's stock
Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .
that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years .

I've seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it ,
a lot of computers like on the one you've got there , it actually has a stick on badge
and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top .
therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other .

that's effectively what they did with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black
if it's for young people , like the phone generation , that thing'd probably go down ,
I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into .

and give no real kinda extra benefit
And then also try and add in technological informat innovation
If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .

Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .
Shall turn it round for time ?

So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever ,
You'd have model one , model two and model three ,
but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here
you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how pliable is Plasticine .

which is in the higher price range .
and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great .

But the way that I interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly ,
The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications .
I'm not what the timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is .
in essence in the production you want things to stay
and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do .

it was to have sizable amount of information on it .

so maybe in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we had .
We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .

the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before .
which is the idea of the watches that you move
the idea that you record in a set message ,
and then it picks up that message and replies to you .
it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo .

And then there's solar cells . as a final option .
So I for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .
And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .
so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .
that seems pretty straight forward .

Wishing I hadn't closed the damn
