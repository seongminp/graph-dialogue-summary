first is the research I made on the remote control itself .
so having researched the existing models within the market , I found my research off the internet . I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .
we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .
and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in a remote control that you could talk to , so .

it's got a very limited number of buttons .
Limit the number of buttons ,
So maybe next to each of the buttons , each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it ,
are we gonna have the channel up and down as as the number buttons ?

And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_
how d how does a remote control look and feel for them ,
and what improvements would they like to remote control .
And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly
and that a even higher proportion would spend more for a s a fancier remote control
they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility
But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions
they've got their own controls in this like hidden panel .

we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls
and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .
And the second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .
and that was the number one frustration that people said , so .

for general television purposes you have channels one to five at this point in time ,
but how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for ?
and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want

but the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,
People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .
Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down .

the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that .
to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .
so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .

there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .
You don't want a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not really a remote .
but as you can see , the left remote is quite quite busy looking , quite complicated .
that's still a video remote part ,
some remotes have favourite options
or like the same technology could be put inside the remote .
if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote
, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as , have you seen those remotes where the bottom bit slides down , so there's everything else revealed ?

W I got or three things , relating to the remote being only for T_V_ .
So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .
So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .
no , like there's individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote .

an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down ,
and we should concentrate on the channels and power , and also volume and that thing , as Louisa said .
Volume button . How many volumes ?

going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote ,
so my personal preference would be the right remote .
My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sleek good looking high-tech

that's there's lots and lots of different buttons .
Would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the circular section ,
we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?
Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .
but he can read a button if it's displayed properly .
That's sixteen buttons , you reckon .

and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway .
And then the sender , which is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .
if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one device .
Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,

we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control .
And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than having it to speech recognition to change the channels .
and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition . .
But you've then got the point if you're not going with voice recognition then
would it take quite a while to develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?

We then have the user interface , which is the like the buttons on the actual remote .
That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .
and maybe a slightly more advanced instruction booklet to come with it , to guide

Alt function F_ eight .
so they incorporate a video function which we won't have to worry about .
I like the use of the symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as as the words on the play functions and all that .
So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing .
and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and
We don't really need any other audio funct functions

And young people were quite receptive to this ,
because young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy our new product if we aim it at sort of a high-tech design .
But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .
Youn young people pref
one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .
Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .
people might just be too fickle and not want to change .

It interprets which button you've pressed
And then maybe an enter button for s , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .
So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , .
and th and a enter button just to select .

and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market ,
But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic
and the idea is to have an international market
the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .

so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .
And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often .
if you're trying to avoid having a second product you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am thing , without sound recognition .
a set command whatever that happened to be .
As in setting the audio and tuning it and like that ?

we've got that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .
so time to market seems to be important ,
because time to market is critical . S

and we'd have to have some room for future such channels .
and there's I exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account Sky and various other various others .
where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .
But a lot of like Cable and Sky and , that would be tuned to one channel ,

we could maybe come up with a menu , a a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .
we could possibly put an L_ a a L_C_D_ menu in ,
So how would this menu function work ?
My dad was watching a film the other week
it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp just off like the menu use different buttons
, my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu ,

And then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual remote .
And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do
the basic components are an energy source

And then on the separate thing we have on the television we have a receiver .
You don't have to be point directly at the television itself .
to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button .
there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise ,
So we're being focused effectively directly at a television
we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,

by the look of it they both have play and fast forward , rewind functions ,
Maybe you could have a fast forward on the channels

So anything that is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick
I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . .
But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .
I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .

I'll just I'll grab the wire out the back of this one .
and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six
it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some whistle back function .
Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment ,
So so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back .
data functions hidden at back .
So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast ,

There's key rings that you whistle at or clap at ,
I was gonna say a sharp noise , a clapping of hand or whatever .
If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option ,
I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle ,

. so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design .
I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as .
whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned .
that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two ,

Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers
I suppose with nine you've got the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it's like multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .
nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a a second or two to press another number ,
I'll put delay to allow multiple numbers .

And then we can report back at the next meeting
And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not until the next meeting .
Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .

and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options .
forty minutes , I believe is the time .

, I s I suppose in a sense you could have if you've got a hundred channels then if you had an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to ten , ten to twenty
We've just got ten , eleven twelve th
Did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers
So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?

And the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned , is becoming dated due to the popularity of the internet .
and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .
that if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext ,

but as soon as we got over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .
On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,

and that's the end of the slide show .
so these are the three extra parameters that have been put on this project .
d first and foremost we've gotta get to the end
and then get to the end with added extras if possible .
the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale ,

because we've got th three primary requisites from from and email that was sent to me
but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within this short time window ,
if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short ,

you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product ,

and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .
that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting .
Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told .

after you press that sends the message to the chip ,
and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .
And the sender sends a message to the receiver .

otherwise it would make it your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances
If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time .
We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by .

because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,
So the top bit's the power source , yes ? .
If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly .

which I in most existing models would be a battery supply .
Whether that'll be two batteries , four batteries , it may vary .
, so we start off with a battery suppl

and the last part is receiver which is important in the system
Maybe we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two .

with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .
that'll solve the frustration of losing it .
Uh-oh danger sign .

Right and the corporate image was the final thing .
we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme .
But I got an email that said to make that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan .
that might be the corporate colour scheme ,

And we did that by giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .

and say right yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed .
So there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround things .

I know it's probably like not an issue to raise here , but the whole thing about not using your standby because of the like waste of electricity .
Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste .
