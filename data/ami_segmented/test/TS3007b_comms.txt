but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control .
So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons ,
Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .

so it not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control ,
they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .
people used to get lost off the remote controller ,
what I did was I dissected current remote controls
what I did was I checked remote controls
and the remote controls of today are all infrared ,
And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a T_V_ or a stereo ,
that wouldn't mean a cheap remote control for us .
we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions ,
that he means that maybe by some option make that remote control and the T_V_ match ,
the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television .

Do we want to use a menu display on the T_V_ ?
if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press .
if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the T_V_
and it displays all your menu options .

and that's partly because a lot of T_V_s have different menus ,
and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .
you d you have to keep in mind that several T_V_s don't even have a menu structure ,
The menus are not identical for all th for all T_V_s ,

Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions ,
Like I said , use one button for m multiple functions ,
If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time ,

Not first change menu options or switch something .
b but make it a separate option in the menu ,

is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote .
we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote .
If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep ,
make a remote that fits easily in the hands
But , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote

it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , speech recognition .
First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly ,
and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
that would be extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control .
because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures .

the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television ,
And those interpreted by the device , in this case the television .
our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .
the channels are different on each te television ,
if you lock on a remote , let's say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television ,
the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television ,

we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .
like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .
just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching ,
an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .

like building in some PIN code
, with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press , you have to press a code for T_V_ .
In codes , y you get a b a book with codes .
and you press code four five on the in the remote

And one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen ,
it's maybe an option if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen ,
and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little little thing or a touch screen .
but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up .
the idea about touch screen is very good .
, they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up ,
then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet
If you make one big touch screen ,
and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .
I've one little question about a total touch screen
because elderly people may be not used to a touch screen ,
You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
because , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen
A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications .
Paper size A_ four . screen size . In this directory .

When you mentioned improving functions , what what do you mean by that
but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup-holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote .
when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one .
we have to keep it simple . Not too many gadgets and functions ,
I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions .
maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to to keep it accessible
you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,
and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen ,
Export . Maybe not export function .

but that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one .
Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi-purpose as we thought ,
So maybe we'll loose a few option options ,
like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .
and maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is ,
, it's a Philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable
Now we just connect the T_V_ type to a set of options , in just in the memory ,
the memory pops up the options .

when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here ,
make clear buttons , easy to use .
and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,
keep the primary buttons visible .
You just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus ,

second , and that's important for the Marketing Expert ,
According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important .
and in the second table the importance of those buttons .
or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the most important functions .
But th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear

one hundred respondents were involved
but nothing's happening on the T_V_ ,
you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the T_V_ ,
they they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_
if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up ,
You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so .

but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on T_V_ , like getting information .
What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?
already digital information is sent t to the standards , T_V_ connections ,
so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_

current T_V_s can even send infrared .
if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what's is on the market today , you should keep it s at this .

so maybe it's an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , , of the T_V_
but if you pick the idea , the left idea
I had another idea about maybe parental control . ,

So that's maybe something for the User Interface Designer .
what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one ,
so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , , but also the user friendliness ,

so that would mean extra cost for the user
That's that's so the h user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , w what happened .
So that's just to to explain the of to make it clearer to the user .
If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .

which allows parents to switch to all channels ,
if children the PIN code , they can't switch to violent channels or
thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels ,
but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels
vi violent channel ,

displaying to the user that something has happened .
so that it's dif dis displayed from displayed here ,
but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r really big numbers
you can de display it on the old style .
that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will to do .

The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire .
so if we want to build a remote control with Bluetooth then the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate ,
that's translated into electric sig electronic signals
in order to receive the signals from what's on T_V_ and such .
because in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,

especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once
if you want to s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do .
if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy
as being apparent that the children cannot use this change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume
so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , , kinda traditionals
then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume

Use big clear buttons . Not too many .
and that's a big ad advantage ,
so they don't you don't have a big thing full of buttons
My executive big room with the panting .

welcome back . At the functional design meeting
and for some design issues , put a logo on it
And so an elder designer picks up th the of

so why should we invent w spend more time on those .
we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that ,
I figure that would be spending too much money and time
but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ?

where it will be received on the receiving end .
we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving .
because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too ,
but whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes ,
then it's be back to the building a receiving if it's actually worth it to build it in ,
the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the email .

but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch
this case it switches a button ,
just hide the few buttons o of switching it open , the usual .
if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines ,
And also like a clapping li like device that pops open .
But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .

that's pretty pretty normal ,
people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than people who are el elder .
, because recently I saw news item on T_V_ about new telephones for elder people .
W we are aiming for younger people

The energy source would be a battery , simple battery
the energy source is connected to the infrared button ,

Second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls .
, persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour ,
because my personal opinion is is not to do Bluetooth or radio waves ,
So I my personal opinion is no receiver .
each time I I had a summary on what you told and what you personal think .
I bring it to my personal room .
I gotta bring it home .

but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure .
and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .
or they have a very simple menu structure ,
and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions .
Ju just a simple log-in , something like that .
so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .

if you want to use a play and back and stop ,
how late do we have to get back be back here ?

the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older ,
but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty .
the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age .
and some interests from the age groups ,
, and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .
we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five .

the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour .
I'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project .
and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour

the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five .
, as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five .
second audience is thirty five percent .
, first of all it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent .

So in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,
they aren't set in a preset order ,
then you set the priority to only parents ,

as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth

and internet will be the main focus .
, because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session .
and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .
so tha that's some of the main points .
that in the middle are the main keys ,
th the main points in this in this meeting is how it's going to look

I have some new findings on Marketing Expert level ,
and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results .
And th those young people , . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy ,
but you have an international market range ,

So we have now a lunch break , finally ,
after the lunch break it's back to individual work , once again thirty minutes .
and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
Thirty minutes lunch break ?
Thirty minutes lunch break , .
The questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or

or an update , software update .
it's most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop .
press start , bling , updated .

and will put the minutes that I have at the end of the session in the shared folder .
Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now ,
I th don't think that's that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
so s they're updated in the shared folder too .
is it possible to store this on the share documents or what

so not more than ten minutes per presentation each ,
Tim and Janus don't talk to ten minutes ,

and use all the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the Word files , what you whatever you want .
when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see ,
I have a Philips H_ fifty five
maybe we can incorporate some U_S_B_ or a firewire connection ,
and download the newest firmware from from the internet .
and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection .

I had an email from the management board
But it's strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet .
and maybe use it in some aesthetic aesthetic form .
I've added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind .
because all things are stored in smart board dot X_D_K_

and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up
