Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself ,

you just said at the start it was a television remote control ,
Television remote control .

So we have the project team , which is to to come up with a new r remote control device .

Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote .
And sometimes they remote controls defeat their own purpose

I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small

I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for .

we need to maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room .

and you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end .

Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .

And our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one ,

you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes ,

I'm the User Interface Designer .

because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .

, so we've got the working design for I_D_ .

And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .
as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room .

method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design
to help you folks design our new model as it were .
For U_I_D_ the technical functions design .

in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device .
we've done some research about what the cutting edge hand held devices are ,

Where we We have twenty five minutes for this meeting .
we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting .
And I I'll try and write up some minutes of this meeting to to give it to you for the next meeting .

during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going .

We've had more time to prepare over this side ,
So I we're looking at having a discussion at this point in time
But at this point in time you're right that shall we make it just a T_V_ .

And so depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .

Next meeting in thirty minutes .
Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ?

Because a lot of systems are T_V_ video combined now ,
or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined .
So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .

Marketing , the user requirement specification .

And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better inst implement than we had before .
And therefore have a successful conclusion to the day .

one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as .

That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but
So it's possible that we could devise a system where you're holding a miniature computer which is controlling all your your television , your stereo ,

Work has been done on this project where by twenty five Euros is the expected selling price .

and therefore to to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .
That information has come from our marketing manager here .

we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time .

and change the water every couple of months ,
So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel ,

So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe .

But is it in a sense it's r mutually exclusive .
And so these are probably mutually exclusive options

We're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half Euro per unit .
And therefore making a profit margin of not actually a profit margin it's because you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from that to give you your profit margin per unit .

Right so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there .
that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat .

so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons .
easy to use so the buttons are accessible .

You get marks for artistic impression .
As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as .

But now you you'll move out from the microphone and the camera .

because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you .

So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got a few fish
fish are are not are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance .

and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear
like the jungle book characters and like that .

Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away

So does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ?

Good job I got pockets today .
so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets .

and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw .

If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .

if you grab the slide to the left and pull it down ?

they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe .

so whenever you're feeling a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always quite excited .
You can sorta get out and they sorta never get tired .

Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach .
